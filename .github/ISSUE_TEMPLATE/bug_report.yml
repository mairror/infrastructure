        Try not to raise a bug report unless you've looked at the logs first.
        If you're running self-hosted, run with Terraform `TF_LOG=trace` in your environment variables and search for whatever reason is causing the problem.
        Paste the *relevant* logs here, not the entire thing and not just a link to the dashboard (others do not have permissions to view them).
